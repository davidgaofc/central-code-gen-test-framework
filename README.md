# Generative AI Benchmarking Framework ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the most comprehensive framework for benchmarking generative AI models! If you're looking to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities of your generative AI, you're in the right place. Our framework aggregates multiple benchmarks, enabling you to assess AI performance across a spectrum of tasks, all in one go!

## Features ðŸ”¥

- **Unified Framework**: Bring together multiple benchmarks under one roof.
- **Easy Testing**: Just a few scripts away from generating results and understanding the prowess of your AI.
- **Aggregated Scoring**: We provide a holistic score taking into consideration various benchmarks, giving you a full view of AI capability.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/davidgaofc/central-code-gen-test-framework.git
    cd central-code-gen-test-framework
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

3. **Setting Up Your Model**

    Make sure to place your generative AI model inside the `llm_call` file and insert the necessary API call.

## Running the Framework ðŸ–¥

Here's a quick overview of how you can run the entire benchmarking:

1. **Generate AI Responses**
    ```bash
    python generate_all.py
    ```
    This will generate outputs from your AI for all the benchmarks included in the framework.

2. **Run Benchmark Tests**
    ```bash
    python test_all.py
    ```
    This will run the benchmark tests on the generated outputs and produce a score for each individual test.

3. **Aggregate Results**
    ```bash
    python total_results.py
    ```
    Fetch an aggregated score for your AI across all the benchmarks. This will give you an overall perspective on how well your AI performs.

## Contribution ðŸ™Œ

Your contributions are always welcome! If you have a new benchmark test or improvement in mind, don't hesitate to fork, modify, and make a pull request.

## Support and Feedback ðŸ“§

For any inquiries, issues, or feedback, please open an issue in the repository or contact David.
